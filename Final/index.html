      <p id="desc"> Welcome to my site! My name is Joe Lollo. I am a junior at UW Bothell from Bellevue, WA,
	majoring in <a class="hover" href="https://www.uwb.edu/ias/undergraduate/majors/culture-literature-arts"><b>Culture, Literature & the Arts</b></a> (CLA) and <a class="hover" href="https://www.uwb.edu/ias/undergraduate/majors/media-communication"><b>Media & Communication Studies</b></a> (MCS).
	This is my final website project for B IMD 233, a web development class I took for the MCS major.
	I had a wonderful time learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in this class, all of which are documented here!

      <h2>Some of my favorite projects and activities from my time at UWB include:</h2>
	<p><strong><a href="https://abbc20.tumblr.com/?og=1">Women in Film Blog & Podcast</a></strong> (Winter 2021): <em>In a group of 4, we learned how to create educational media content over Tumblr and SoundCloud surrounding the way women's perceived "beauty" and "ugliness" are represented in media.</p></em>
	<p><strong>Student-Authored Exam</strong> (Fall 2020): <em>In my post-colonial literature class last fall, I got to design my own exam based on the most interesting things we read in that class, and then have students take it (for no credit, thankfully!). It was a load of fun to write this project because I could reflect on the things I liked the most and wanted both myself and other students to remember from the class.</em></p>
	<p><strong>The <a href="https://uwnewman.org">Catholic Newman Center</a> at UW Seattle</strong> (Winter/Spring 2020 - Present): <em>This is the church I currently go to, as it caters to UW students on all 3 campuses. I presently have a leadership position and enjoy building community with other students there, including on retreats.</p></em>
	<p><strong><a href="https://victoriaduflot.com/data-visualization">Edmonds School District Data Visualization Project</a></strong> (Fall 2019): <em>In my data visualization class, we learned how to use Tableau to visually represent data and draw conclusions we couldn't find from the data alone. My group, linked here, assessed communication and various issues within schools, between families and school representatives.  Collaboration was extremely important in this protect. Sorting such a tremendous amount of data required us to work efficiently. Our ability to use each other’s strengths, to listen to each other and to communicate is what I believe, led to our success.</em></p>
	<p><strong>Playing Music</strong> (2011-present): <em>It's not really a thing I started doing at UW Bothell, but I wanted to share it here because music is one of my favorite hobbies. I have been playing the guitar for 10 years, am always looking for new music to play, and I also sing and have been writing songs recently.</em></p>
